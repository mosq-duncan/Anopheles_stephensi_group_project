Simplified model (did not use carrying capacity by hexagon)

Yi∼Bernoulli(pi)
where pi is the probability of Anopheles stephensi presence.
Predictor covariates
	X1 = Built volume
	X2 = tcb (Tasselled Cap Brightness)
	X3 = tcw (Tasselled Cap Wetness)
	X4 = estimated climatic relative abundance for An. stephensi
The predictors are combined linearly
ηi=β0+β1X1i+β2X2i+β3X3i+β4X4i
where:
	ηi is the log-odds 
	β0 is the intercept
	β1,β2,...,β4 are the regression coefficients for each predictor
To get the probability of presence pi, the logistic (sigmoid) function ensured pi is between 0 and 1.
1 / (1 + e^(-ηi ))
Priors
Assumption of normal priors. Where N(0,1) is a standard normal distribution
βj∼N(0,1),for j=0,1,2,3,4

Predicted probabilities
Pnew=1/(1+e^(-(β0+β1X1+⋯β4X4) ))
Prediction into new locations
Ynew∼Bernoulli(Pnew)


Next steps:
	Work on the Kenya only model
	Re-try the model incorporating carrying capacity in hexagons
